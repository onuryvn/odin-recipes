        <p class="para">The <strong>Pizza Margherita</strong> is one of the most famous and classic pizza varieties in the world. 
            It originates from Naples, Italy, and is known for its simple yet high-quality ingredients.</p>
        <p class="para"> It was allegedly created in 1889 by the Neapolitan pizza maker Raffaele Esposito for Queen Margherita of Savoy. 
            He wanted to make a pizza that represented the colors of the Italian flag:</p>

        </ul>

        <h2 class="ingr">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>3 Â½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
            <li>2 cups pizza sauce</li>
            <li>20 slices fresh Mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>20 leaves fresh basil</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>sea salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Mix water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl.
                Let stand until yeast begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir half the flour mixture into yeast mixture until no dry spots remain.
                Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition.
                When dough pulls together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil.
                Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
                Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form each into a ball.</li>    
            <li>Preheat oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Stretch out and pat 1 dough ball to form a circle 10 to 12 inches in diameter.
                Place dough on a lightly floured pizza peel. Top with 1/2 cup of tomato sauce and spread to cover within an inch of the edge of the dough.
                Arrange 5 slices of mozzarella cheese on top of the tomato sauce, then place 5 basil leaves on top.
                Drizzle pizza with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt to taste. Repeat for 3 remaining dough balls.</li>
            <li>Slide each pizza onto the pizza stone in the preheated oven. Bake until cheese is bubbly and the underside of the crust is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
