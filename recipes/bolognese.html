        <h2 class="desc">Description</h2>
        <p class="para">Spaghetti Bolognese is one of the most popular pasta dishes worldwide, but interestingly, 
        it is not an authentic Italian dish—at least, not in the way most people think!</p>
        <p class="para">The dish is inspired by Ragù alla Bolognese, a traditional meat sauce from Bologna, Italy.
            However, in Italy, this sauce is never served with spaghetti! 
            Instead, it is typically paired with tagliatelle (a flat, ribbon-like pasta) because the sauce clings better to its surface.</p>
        
        <h2 class="ingr">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="list">

        <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>The dish is inspired by Ragù alla Bolognese, a traditional meat sauce from Bologna, Italy.
                However, in Italy, this sauce is never served with spaghetti! Instead, it is typically paired with tagliatelle (a flat, ribbon-like pasta) because the sauce clings better to its surface.
                Stir in spaghetti and return to a boil. Cook spaghetti uncovered, stirring occasionally,
                until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes.
                Add onion, celery, carrot, and oregano; continue cooking until vegetables begin to soften, 8 to 10 minutes.
                Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Crumble in ground beef; 
                cook and stir until no longer pink and completely cooked, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour vinegar over ground beef mixture; simmer until liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes.
                Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and sugar; bring to a boil,
                season with salt and black pepper, then remove from heat. Stir in basil.</li>
            <li>Spoon sauce over spaghetti; top with Parmesan cheese to serve.</li>
        </ol>
