        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Doner Kebab</strong> is a popular Turkish dish made from seasoned meat (usually lamb, beef, or chicken) stacked on a vertical rotisserie. 
            As the meat cooks, thin slices are shaved off and served in flatbreads, pita, wraps, or with rice and salad.</p>
        <p>Although the meal is originally Turkish, it is said, that the dish was first founded in the German capital Berlin by a Turkish immigrant.
            Hence why the capital's most famous fast food is the Doner, and the German populus agreeing that the best and most original Doner is found there.</p>
